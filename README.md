# LCMStrategy - Polygon Liquidity Management Contract

This smart contract implements a liquidity management strategy on the Polygon network using Uniswap V3 and CryptoAlgebra. The contract allows users to automatically manage their liquidity positions within specific ranges to optimize profits.

## Features

- **Add Liquidity:** Users can add liquidity to the contract using the `mint` function, which issues shares to represent their stake.
- **Remove Liquidity:** Users can withdraw their liquidity by calling the `burn` function, which returns the original tokens (e.g., WMATIC and USDC.e).
- **Rebalancing:** The contract periodically optimizes liquidity ranges with the `rebalance` function to adapt to market changes.

## Contract Structure

- **Events:** Defines events like `Mint`, `Burn`, `Hold`, and `Rebalance` to track liquidity operations and user actions.
- **Ticks:** Uses data structures such as `Tick` and `PartialTick` to manage liquidity ranges within the pool.
- **Safe Transactions:** Utilizes libraries like `SafeMath` and `SafeCast` to prevent numerical overflows and ensure secure calculations.

## Prerequisites

- Polygon Network
- Libraries: `SafeMath`, `SafeCast`
- Access to Uniswap V3 or similar liquidity pools on the Polygon network

## How to Use

1. **Deploy the Contract:** Initialize the contract with required addresses (`factory`, `pool`, `manager`, etc.).
2. **Add Liquidity:** Use the `mint` function to add liquidity to the contract and receive shares.
3. **Manage Liquidity:** Rebalance or remove liquidity using the `rebalance` and `burn` functions.

## Important Functions

- **`mint`:** Adds liquidity to the contract and mints shares for the user.
- **`burn`:** Burns user shares and returns the corresponding token amounts.
- **`rebalance`:** Optimizes the liquidity ranges based on market conditions.
